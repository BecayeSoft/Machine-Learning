# Data versioning

DVC (Data Version Control) is a great tool to track (not only) data. It is the Git for Data.

**Install DVC**
```
pip install dvc
```

In this folder:
* *Introduction to DVC* is a hands-on tutorial on how to use DVC.
* *Tracking Iris data with DVC* is another tutorial on how to track Iris data with DVC which I strongly recommend.

You can find my article on Medium: [Tracking iris data with DVC](https://medium.com/p/70795919d262).
